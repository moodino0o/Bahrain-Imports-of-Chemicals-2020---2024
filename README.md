# Bahrain Imports of Chemicals 2020 - 2024
Between 2020 and 2024, a total of 109.11 billion kilograms of goods were imported, of which 16.51 billion kilograms were chemicals, representing 15.13% of the total imported quantity. The imports originated mainly from Brazil, Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Chile, with Brazil contributing the largest share at 49 billion kilograms. The total cost of these imports was 27.61 billion BD.
The problem is to analyze the import patterns of chemicals, identify the key source countries contributing to the imports, and evaluate the economic and logistical impact of chemical imports on the overall trade. The insights can help optimize supply chains, reduce import dependency, and plan cost-effective procurement strategies.

# Insights & Findings
- 15.13% of the total imported goods are chemicals.
- The total import cost of chemicals is BD 2.82 billion.
- Australia is the top importing country for these chemicals.

# Top Imported Chemicals

- Other Aluminium Oxide — Inorganic Chemical

- Refractory Cements, Mortars, Concretes, and the Like — Miscellaneous Chemical

- Other Esters of Inorganic Acids and Their Salts (including halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated, or intros derivatives) — Organic Chemical

# Recommendations

- Local Chemical Manufacturing – Develop domestic production capabilities to reduce import dependency.

- Regional Sourcing – Strengthen partnerships with nearby countries for more cost-effective and reliable supply.

- Chemical Recycling – Implement recycling programs to recover and reuse chemical materials, reducing import needs and environmental impact.
